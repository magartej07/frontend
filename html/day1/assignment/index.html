        Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (born 5 February 1985) is a
        Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and
        captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national
        team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all-time,
        Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA
        Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the
        most by a European player. He has won 34 trophies in his career,
        including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA
        European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the
        records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the
        Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international
        goals (128) and international appearances (205). He is one of the few
        players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the
        most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior
        career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all
        time.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 36px">
        Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with
        Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He
        would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League titles, the
        Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his
        first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive
        association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in
        a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million). He became a key contributor
        and formed an attacking trio with Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale which
        was integral to the team winning four Champions Leagues from 2014 to
        2018, including La Décima. During this period, he won back-to-back
        Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017, and was
        runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived career rival.
        He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and the all-time top
        scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top
        scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real,
        Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, two Copas del
        Rey, two UEFA Super Cups and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed
        for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million (£88 million),
        the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30
        years old. He won two Serie A titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies
        and a Coppa Italia, became the inaugural Serie A Most Valuable Player
        and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English,
        Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021,
        finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his
        contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.

        Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of
        18 and has since earned more than 200 caps, making him both the country
        and history's most-capped player of all time, recognised by the Guinness
        World Records.[9] With more than 100 goals at international level, he is
        also the sports all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and
        scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international
        goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed
        captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named
        the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football
        Federation. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major
        tournament title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the
        second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see
        him receive his fourth Ballon d'Or. He also led them to victory in the
        inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award in
        the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro
        2020.

      <p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 36px">
        One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was
        ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016, 2017, and
        2023, and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019.
        Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in
        the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to
        earn US$1 billion in his career.
